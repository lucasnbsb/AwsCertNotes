# S3

- Blob storage
- Backup
- Disaster Recovery
- Archive
- Hybrid Cloud Storage
- Application Hosting
- Media Hosting
- Data Lakes
- Software deliver
- Static Websites
- All classes store in 3 AZs minimum

Stores files into Buckets with _Globally unique names_
The only globally unique name service in amazon

- Naming Convention
  - No Uppercase
  - No underscores
  - 3-63 characters
  - Not an IP
  - starts with lower letter or number
  - no `xn--` as prefix
  - no `-s3alias` as suffix

### Objects

The **Key** is the full path of the file
`prefix + object name`

_S3 does not store directories, but it looks like it, it's all Keys_
max upload is 5GB, more and you need to use **multi-part upload**
buckets can be encrypted with keys

- each object has
  - Metadata in key/value pairs
  - Tags <=10
  - Version ID (if versioning is enabled)

By default buckets are not public, you access them with a _Pre-signed Url_ an url that encodes your keys within

### Security

- User Based
  - IAM policies
- Resource Based
  - Bucket Poliocies
  - Object Access Control list (ACL) - finer grain
  - Bucket Access Control list (ACL)

* An IAM principal can access if\*
  - (the IAM _allows_ || the resource policy _Allows_) && theres no explicit _Deny_
  - Blocks take precedence to prevent data keajs

#### Policies

- Resource
- Effect: allow/deny
- Actions: API to allow/deny
- principal: Account or user to apply the policy

**To grant access to EC2 instances use ROLES**

Cross-Acount acees is an option in the policy

#### Static Website Hosting

- Use a public policy or you get a 403

#### Versioning

- Especialy usefull for static websites
- Enabled at bucket level
- ovewrites on the same key update the version
- protects agains unintended deletes
- easy rollbacks
- files not versioned prior to enabling have null version
- Suspending does not delete versions

#### Replication

- **MUST enable versioning**
- Cross-Region (CRR)
  - compliance
  - latency
  - cross acount replication
- Same-Region (SRR)
  - log aggregation
  - prod and dev environments
- copying is async
- **MUST give propper IAM perm**
- There is Batch replication
- you can replicate delete markers (optional)
- No chaining of replication ( not transitive )

### Storage Classes

_Durability_: 1/expected file loss, s3 has 11 9's of durability for all storage classes
_Availability_: 4 9's of availability (53 minutes of downtime/year)

- Standart
  - frequently acessed data
  - low latency
  - high througput
  - tanks 2 concurrent facility failures
  - use it for:
    - Big data analytics
    - gaming apps
    - CDN
- Standart-Infrequent-Acess (IA)
  - Lower cost
  - cost on retreival
  - 3 9s of availability
  - Disaster recovery and backups
- One-Zone-IA
  - 99.5 availability
  - high durability in a single AZ
  - if the AZ is lost then data lost
- Glacier
  - low cost + retrieval cost
  - use it for backup
  - Instant retrieval
    - milisecond retrieval
    - minimum duration of 90 days
  - Flexible retrieval
    - expedited (1-5 minutes)
    - standart (3-5 hours)
    - bulk (5 to 12 hours) free
    - minimum duration of 90 days
  - Deep Archive
    - standard 12 hours
    - bulk 48 hours
    - minimum store duration: 180 days

S3 Intelligent-Tiering

- moves automatically
- Frequent Access (default)
  - 30 days -> IA (Auto)
  - 90 days -> Archive IA (Auto)
  - 90 ~ 700 days -> Archive Access (Optional)
  - 180 ~ 700+ -> Deep archive (Optional)
