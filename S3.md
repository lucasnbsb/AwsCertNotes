# S3

- Blob storage
- Backup
- Disaster Recovery
- Archive
- Hybrid Cloud Storage
- Application Hosting
- Media Hosting
- Data Lakes
- Software deliver
- Static Websites
- All classes store in 3 AZs minimum

Stores files into Buckets with _Globally unique names_
The only globally unique name service in amazon

- Naming Convention
  - No Uppercase
  - No underscores
  - 3-63 characters
  - Not an IP
  - starts with lower letter or number
  - no `xn--` as prefix
  - no `-s3alias` as suffix

### Objects

The **Key** is the full path of the file
`prefix + object name`

_S3 does not store directories, but it looks like it, it's all Keys_
max upload is 5GB, more and you need to use **multi-part upload**
buckets can be encrypted with keys

- each object has
  - Metadata in key/value pairs
  - Tags <=10
  - Version ID (if versioning is enabled)

By default buckets are not public, you access them with a _Pre-signed Url_ an url that encodes your keys within

### Security

- User Based
  - IAM policies
- Resource Based
  - Bucket Poliocies
  - Object Access Control list (ACL) - finer grain
  - Bucket Access Control list (ACL)

* An IAM principal can access if\*
  - (the IAM _allows_ || the resource policy _Allows_) && theres no explicit _Deny_
  - Blocks take precedence to prevent data keajs

#### Policies

- Resource
- Effect: allow/deny
- Actions: API to allow/deny
- principal: Account or user to apply the policy

**To grant access to EC2 instances use ROLES**

Cross-Acount acees is an option in the policy

#### Static Website Hosting

- Use a public policy or you get a 403

#### Versioning

- Especialy usefull for static websites
- Enabled at bucket level
- ovewrites on the same key update the version
- protects agains unintended deletes
- easy rollbacks
- files not versioned prior to enabling have null version
- Suspending does not delete versions

#### Replication

- **MUST enable versioning**
- Cross-Region (CRR)
  - compliance
  - latency
  - cross acount replication
- Same-Region (SRR)
  - log aggregation
  - prod and dev environments
- copying is async
- **MUST give propper IAM perm**
- There is Batch replication
- you can replicate delete markers (optional)
- No chaining of replication ( not transitive )

### Storage Classes

_Durability_: 1/expected file loss, s3 has 11 9's of durability for all storage classes
_Availability_: 4 9's of availability (53 minutes of downtime/year)

- Standart
  - frequently acessed data
  - low latency
  - high througput
  - tanks 2 concurrent facility failures
  - use it for:
    - Big data analytics
    - gaming apps
    - CDN
- Standart-Infrequent-Acess (IA)
  - Lower cost
  - cost on retreival
  - 3 9s of availability
  - Disaster recovery and backups
- One-Zone-IA
  - 99.5 availability
  - high durability in a single AZ
  - if the AZ is lost then data lost
- Glacier
  - low cost + retrieval cost
  - use it for backup
  - Instant retrieval
    - milisecond retrieval
    - minimum duration of 90 days
  - Flexible retrieval
    - expedited (1-5 minutes)
    - standart (3-5 hours)
    - bulk (5 to 12 hours) free
    - minimum duration of 90 days
  - Deep Archive
    - standard 12 hours
    - bulk 48 hours
    - minimum store duration: 180 days

#### S3 Intelligent-Tiering

- moves automatically
- Frequent Access (default)
  - 30 days -> IA (Auto)
  - 90 days -> Archive IA (Auto)
  - 90 ~ 700 days -> Archive Access (Optional)
  - 180 ~ 700+ -> Deep archive (Optional)

### Lifecycle Rules - Moving between storage Classes

- _Must have versioning turned On_
- you can set rules based on days unused
- you can select number of versions to keep
- You can selec how long versions live
- How long before permanent deletion

#### S3 Analytics

- S3 analytics can recommend you the best classes to use based on previous use
- the report takes 1 to 2 days to update

### S3 Event Notification

- S3:ObjectCreated
- S3:ObjectRemoved
- S3:ObjectRestore
- S3:ObjectReplication

you can create as many as you need. They get into the destination within minutes

- Usualy uses _EventBridge_ to send events to up to 18 services
- otherwise you can just set up _Event notifications_ in your bucket and they go directly
- You can send them into a SQS queue for durability

### S3 Performance

- expected latency 100-200ms
- 3.5k put/copy/post/delete per sec per prefix
- 5.5k get/head per sec per prefix
- No limit to the amount of prefixes in a bucket

#### Multi-part upload

- Recommended for > 100MB
- Mandatory for > 5GB

#### S3 Transfer Acceleration

- transfer to an Edge location and forwards to S3 bucket in the target region
- goes through private Amazon internet
- compatible with multi-part upload

#### S3 Byte-range fetches

- Paralelize the gets by requesting specific byte ranges
- you can call just the header of the file for quick metadata access

#### S3 Select & Glacier Select

- Simple in-file Server-side filtering using **SQL**
- faster and cheaper than getting the entire file

#### User-defined Object Metadata & S3 Object Tags

- User-defined metadata
  - in the form of Key-value pairs
  - defined on _upload time_
  - keys in _lowercase_
  - metadata can be retrieved first
- S3 Object Tags
  - can be used for fine grained permissions
  - Also key-value pairs
  - Usefull for analytics

**METADATA AND TAGS ARE NOT SEARCHABLE**
To search you must build an external DB as search index ( usualy dynamoDB )

### S3 Security

- SSE: server-side encryption
  - SSE-S3: Amazon S3 managed keys (default)
    - managed key
    - AES-256
    - set the header: x-amz-server-side-encryption: AES256
    - default on new buckets & objects
  - SSE KMS keys stored in KMS
    - You manage your keys in KMS (key management Service)
    - you audit with CloudTrail
    - set the header: x-amz-server-side-encryption: "aws:kms"
    - Limitations
      - KMS API may rate-limit you
      - increase quotas through the quotas console
  - SSE-C
    - keys are stored outside of AWS
    - S3 does not store your key
    - **HTTPS MUST BE USED**
    - you must provide the key in the headers
- Client-Side Encryption
  - Use any client side library
    - Amazon S3 Client-Side Encryption Library for instance
- Encryption in transit (SSL / TLS)
  - in-flight encryption
  - 2 endpoints
  - http
  - https (recommended and mandatory for SSE-C)

#### Default Encryption Vs Bucket Policies

- SSE-S3 is on by default but...
- You can force encryption through policy (forces the header)
- _Policies are evaluated before the default encryption_

#### CORS

**Origin = protocol(scheme) + host(domain) + port**
requests going across different origins must be cross enabled

- first there is an OPTIONS call ( _preflight request_ )
- the server responds with the CORS headers: (_preflight response_)
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <origin of the caller>`
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Methods: <hhtp methods allowed>`
- Client then sends the request he intended if it is alowed

To make cross-origin requests on our buckets we need to enable the correct _ CORS headers _

You can allow an specific origin or any (\*)

#### MFA Delete

first enable Versioning. Then _Only the root acount_ can enable MFA Delete
If on, MFA is required for any destructive operations

### S3 Access Logs

- **DONT USE YOUR LOGGING BUCKET AS A MONITORED BUCKET**
  - that creates a logging loop and your bucket grows exponentially

### S3 Pre-Signed URLs

- Generate with the console, CLI or SDK
- Whoever uses the url inherits the permissions for Get/Put
- Expiration
  - Console: 1 ~ 720 min
  - CLI: expires in: 3600 secs ~ 604800secs (168 hours)

### S3 Access Points

it's a policy to grant R/W to specific prefixes, attatch IAM users to whatever policies you want
Each AP has:

- Own DNS
- an AP policy

APs can be accessed from within a vpc through a VPC endpoint ( with it's own policy )

### S3 Object Lambda

- Modify the object before being retrieved by the caller
- Create a Lambda function
- Create the S3 Ap and a S3 Object Lambda AP
- The lambda is called and runs over the object
- Use it for:
  - resizing and watermarking
  - enriching data, redacting data

- Create a Lambda function
- Create the S3 Ap and a S3 Object Lambda AP
